The camera is better than and the Apple iPhones and Samsung phones in terms of clarity and stability. It is a DSLR camera packed in a small package. The battery performance is also great to the massive 3700 maH capacity. I charge my phone only 2 days once. The interface is user friendly moreover the phone is ultimately fast there is no lag observed in this phone. Thanks to the oneplus team for such a wonderful product.,18-Apr-19,

6,Kevin Miranda,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Underdog Champion,"Review after 5 months of usage. Pre-ordered and purchased it as soon as it was released in India, way back in November 2018.PROS:----------------‚Ä¢ GREAT BATTERY LIFE: 2~2.5 days on moderate - light usage; 1~1.5 days on intense - heavy usage.Average screen on time: 5~6 hours. Max I've got: 9.5 hours.‚Ä¢ IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE: Whether you're gaming, watching Netflix, chatting or have 30+ Chrome tabs open, prepare to have a smooth and seamless experience. No lags or stutters whatsoever (Just restart your phone once or twice a month; clear system cache if required.)‚Ä¢ GOOD CAMERA: Agreed, the camera quality is not on par with the likes of the top-of-the-line Samsungs or Apples; but for this price range, it's extremely impressive. Detailed & crisp pictures in daylight, impressive low light photography, albeit with a few trade-offs here and there.‚Ä¢ CUTTING EDGE IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR: The concealed fingerprint scanner is definitely faster than the others out there, usually unlocks within a couple of milliseconds on the first try, but also doesn't work as it should rarely. This is more on the software optimization side. You'll need to place your finger correctly else, you'll be stuck with your thumb on the screen for a couple of seconds. But hey, when it works, it's the best out there.‚Ä¢ RAPID CHARGE: The fastest charging device out there currently IMO. Goes to 100% in almost an hour. (Charging happens rapidly when the battery level is below 50%, and the speed slowly reduces as the battery percentage increases. This is to reduce damage to the device and the user.)‚Ä¢ SMOOTH & SLICK OS: I love the UI & UX of Oxygen OS. Feels almost like stock Android, but with a few perks added here and there. Feels extremely zippy executing any task.‚Ä¢ STUNNING DESIGN & BUILD: The build quality & design of this phone is extremely impressive. Looks slick, like a beautifully crafted piece of shiny black metal. The phone feels solid and heavy too (the weight might be a con according to your preferences). Oh and the notch! Don't worry, it looks beautiful and you'll never really notice it being there once you start using the device (You can hide it if you want through the OS).CONS:----------------‚Ä¢ RIP HEADPHONE JACK: I know, the phone is advertised without having a headphone jack and with a supplied Type-C to 3.5mm dongle, but you can't always carry the dongle around, can you? You'll miss the convenience of having one initially, but after a couple of weeks, you'll get used to it. If you get the OnePlus Type-C Bullets, you won't miss the 3.5mm jack in a very short time. The Type-C Bullets sound extremely good with the in-built DAC of the 6T.‚Ä¢ BLURRY NIGHTSCAPE/NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY: The Nightscape mode of the 6T could use some work. There are two modes of operation: 1) If the phone senses that it's being propped up by a stand or is stable, the camera takes longer to shoot low light pictures with a slow shutter, allowing more light to pass through. 2) If you're holding it in your hand, it takes approx 1~2s to shoot low light photos.The output is not always crisp. It's a bit blurry/smoothened out. As long as you don't zoom closely into the subject, it'll look good.‚Ä¢ IN-BUILD SPEAKER & EARPIECE: The loudspeaker sounds slightly tinny with the highs overpowering the mids and the bass. You almost can't really hear the bass. The earpiece is kinda tiny and is placed on top of the frame of the device. It's almost invisible and sometimes (only sometimes) I have a hard time hearing the other person on the call. It's loud enough, just not clear enough.‚Ä¢ EXTREMELY POOR HAPTIC VIBRATION: Trust me on this. The vibration motor on all OnePlus devices (Tested the OP X, 3, 3T, 5, 5T, 6 & 6T) are almost non-existent if you carry your phone in your jean pocket. You can only feel it if you're holding it in your hand. You'll NEVER feel it vibrating if you have it in your pocket.‚Ä¢ BLURRY SELFIES: While the rear camera is top-notch, the front snapper is not so much. Agreed it gives out beautiful selfies, but that's only when it works properly. 2~3 photos out of 5 snapped using the front camera turn out blurred. You have to hold the phone REALLY steady if you want a good picture on the first attempt.Thumbs up if you found this helpful!",18-Apr-19,
